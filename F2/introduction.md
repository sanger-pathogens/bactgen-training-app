Genome sequence data can be used to characterise bacteria, including prediction of antimicrobial resistance, serotyping and clustering into lineages. GPS country partners and the core GPS team have analysed _S. pneumoniae_ WGS data from individual countries, in some cases comparing the _S. pneumoniae_ population pre- and post- implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for infants. In this module we will use example data for isolates from Brazil to

1. Learn how to assess the quality of sequence data
2. Understand how assemblies are generated
3. Use a drag and drop online tool to determine genotype
4. View isolate metadata, including genotype, alongside a phylogeny in Microreact
